# internet-research
Created by Alex Toneka. Texas-born computer hobbyist.

A website for myself to serve as a homepage of sorts for Internet Research. Mostly containing bookmarks that can be tagged, sorted, and edited, this website will also be a learning ground for me to develop my coding skills. 

A work in progress on Github since 09-06-2016.
